<p> Ut enim and minim veniam, quis...He reached the place of the sun in the early 
	morning just as the glowing, golden orb was rising from the earth and beginning
	 his daily journey through the sky. He touched the end of the long reed to the flames, 
	 and the dry pith caught on fire and burned slowly. </p>
	 
	 <p>As he was walking by the shore of the sea he found a reed, or, as some say, a tall
	    stalk of fennel, growing; and when he had broken it off he saw that its hollow center
	    was filled with a dry, soft pith which would burn slowly and keep on fire a long
	    time. He took the long stalk in his hands, and started with it towards the dwelling
	    of the sun in the far east.</p>
