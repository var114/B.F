	    <p>He reached the place of the sun in the early morning just as the glowing, golden
	    orb was rising from the earth and beginning his daily journey through the sky. He
	    touched the end of the long reed to the flames, and the dry pith caught on fire and
	    burned slowly. He called some of the shivering men from their caves and built a fire for them,
	    and showed them how to warm themselves by it and how to build other fires from the
	    coals. Soon there was a cheerful blaze in every rude home in the land, and men and
	    women gathered round it and were warm and happy, and thankful to Prometheus for the
	    wonderful gift which he had brought to them from the sun.</p>
		
		<p>As he was walking by the shore of the sea he found a reed, or, as some say, a tall
		    stalk of fennel, growing; and when he had broken it off he saw that its hollow center
		    was filled with a dry, soft pith which would burn slowly and keep on fire a long
		    time. He took the long stalk in his hands, and started with it towards the dwelling
		    of the sun in the far east.</p>
